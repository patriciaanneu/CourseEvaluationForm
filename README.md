Implement an HTML document containing an online evaluation form for CE (Continuing Education) courses offered at a college. A screenshot of the scanned paper-based form can be seen on the following page. Make sure to ask the same type of questions even if you edit slightly the wording.<br>
You can modify the layout of the form.

Create a banner (hint: use the header tag) containing a logo picture for the college and hyperlink it to the college website (home page).
Use colours of your choice on the form and harmonize them with the palette of the chosen college website (hint: do not use a yellow background as in the scanned paper form).
Do all the styling of you form using CSS rules saved in a separate .css style sheet.
Make sure the website and email addresses on the sample form are implemented as hyperlinks that the user can interact with.
Uplooad your assignment4.html file to the studentweb server, and provide a hyperlink to it from your index.html.
